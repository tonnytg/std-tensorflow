### WIP - Celcius to Fahrenheit

This examples is so simple and amazing in same time.

Creating a Input and Output example of data. After create a one layer of neural network with one neuron.
Than, we train the model with epochs to create a model that can convert Celcius to Fahrenheit.

We can use this model to ask to the model to convert a Celcius to Fahrenheit.

This is so amazing because we din't say formules to Machine Learning, we just give a lot of examples and the model learn by itself.
